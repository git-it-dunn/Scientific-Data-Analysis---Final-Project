Introduction
This dataset is a collection of 802 pokemon from all seven generations of pokemon. It contains information on these pokemon, such as their name, attack, defence, their weight, and other relevant information. Information collected from https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon.  This dataset has so much information on each of the pokemon, much can be discovered about the pokemon universe. We asked questions that explored how pokemon compare to each other and their many attributes. Asking questions like “what is the best glass cannon pokemon” seeks out the greatest single hitter pokemon. Asking questions like how two attributes in a single pokemon compare, we can gain wisdom on which pokemon might be best in some situations.  


Discussion
After analysis of the data, we can give our results to the questions we made previous to this report.  To restate, these questions aim to find some stat or best feature of a given pokemon or grouping of pokemon.  

In our first question, we aimed to find how type and defence relate to one another.  This means finding the average for each type of pokemon and finding which one yielded higher defence stats.  After calculating to find the averages of each, we came up with the concluded that steal was the stronest.

The graph we made shows the average defence per type.  The highest two come with no surprise with steel and rock having the highest stats.  The weakest is normal with others coming close and them being electric and poison.

Another question we seeked to answer is whether or not weight had an affect on the attack of a pokemon.  In order to do this we sought out the correlation of the two stats: weight and attack as well as weight and special attack.  We found that the correlation between weight attack to be 0.382183.  This is a relatively small number but it does prove that as weight increases, the attack slightly does as well.  Though this value isn't above 0.5 which means it isn't a significant number. For the weight and special attack, the number was 0.235218 which is even smaller than the previous value meaning it is less significant.  But, it still does show there is a very small correlation between weight and special attack.

We wondered what the greatest offensive pokemon would be so we searched for the pokemon with the highest attack and speed stat combination.  We found that Mega-Aerodactyle was the greatest in this case.  We found this by sorting through rock type pokemon because they had the best ratio of being effective vs not.  Rock type had a ratio of 4:3 which means it's more effective against more types compared to other types of pokemon.

Conclusion 

Though this data set will give us almost an infinite amount of questions about each pokemon, this of which in competitive pokemon could be a huge strong suit for the person with it in making the best team. A couple of those questions we asked and found the answers, first being finding which pokemon type has the greatest attack stat of all of pokemon through comparing the attack stats of each pokemon and relating them with the other pokemon of the same typing. Through this method we could find that fighting type pokemon tend to have the highest attack stat of all pokemon types.With this information you can find that if you need a hard hitting pokemon then looking into the fighting type pokemon could be your best option. Through a similar method you can find the type of pokemon with the greatest defence or special defence of all pokemon. So with this if you need a strong physically defensive pokemon on your team, pokemon of the steel type would be great for you. For the specially defensive you can find that physic pokemon have great special defence but not so great physical defence so you can take that information and choose what is best for your team and what you need. In pokemon when building teams you normally find one pokemon and build your team around that one pokemon taking its weaknesses and having other pokemon to then help out to take care of those weaknesses so we wanted to find the best pokemon to have the least amount of those weaknesses so we found the best type combination being steel and fairy then found the best pokemon with that type combination being Magearna (800) having the best stats of that type. And if you need a strong fast offensive pokemon we looked through the types that had the most types it was effective against and found the pokemon with the best speed and attack stats and this led us to say that Aerodactyl or in this case, Mega-Aerodactyl fits the most into this role.
